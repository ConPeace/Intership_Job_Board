 Join our community of solvers in cultivating a collaborative workplace driven by unique perspectives. We’re proud PwC Canada advances a culture that helps everyone thrive. It's one of the reasons we're recognized as a top employer in Canada. As you build a career with purpose and build meaningful connections that’ll last a lifetime, you'll work with people from diverse backgrounds and industries to help solve important problems, powered by the latest technology, to turn today's ideas into tomorrow's solutions. 
 
 PwC Canada is committed to cultivating an inclusive, hybrid work environment - one that is collaborative, supportive and productive. We work in-person and virtually, as is best suited for our clients, teams and people. We want you to be intentional with your work, how you do it and where it’s done. PwC offices are hubs of connectivity and learning. We strongly encourage our people to prioritize in-person work, whether it’s in the office or at a client site. This means we expect you to be in-person (either with clients or in the office) at least half of your time. 
 
 We know that hybrid work is all about balance, and capturing the benefits of in-person work is essential to your growth at the firm. Exact expectations for your team can be discussed with your interviewer. 
 
 What you’ll create and do 
 
 Today’s interconnected digital ecosystem means that handling the immediate and long-term impact of risks is a major concern for our clients. Our clients are also investing in technology to transform their businesses and turn risks into opportunities. Our team in risk assurance helps our clients create proactive, preventative and holistic approaches to information risk, bringing a full range of expertise to address our clients’ business challenges. We help clients navigate today’s complex business and technology environment and help them build trust and confidence in the systems and processes enabled by technology they depend on to run their businesses. 
 
 In Risk Assurance Services, you’ll gain exposure to a variety of clients, industries and technologies. You’ll gain knowledge, experience and mentorship needed to grow as a professional who not only understands the relevant technology risks of today, but can also communicate and provide guidance to our clients in this constantly evolving space. You’ll gain opportunities to interact with senior management at clients and continue to build your own brand in the marketplace. 
 
 By creatively using the many resources at your disposal (off-shore service centers, data transformation and visualisation tools as well as purpose built tools and accelerators), you’ll help provide assurance to our clients over their technology driven controls and business processes. The increase in significant client transformations as a result of cloud based technology and emerging technologies further creates an opportunity for you to gain diverse and interesting experiences. 
 
 What you’ll bring to this role: 
 
 With connectivity being a key enabler of our strategy, our objective is to become the most connected firm - connected to our clients, our communities and to each other. PwC follows an Activity Based Work model, where our PwC professionals engage in a diverse range of activities from our offices, from client sites, or our homes. 
 
 
  Available for a period of 4 months 
  Enrolled in post secondary education 
 
 
  An interest in upskilling for a digital world and technology trends, an openness to learning new tools and adapting how you work 
  A demonstrated commitment to valuing differences and working alongside diverse people and perspectives 
  Strong written and verbal communication skills to articulate new ideas 
 
 
  Highly detail oriented with excellent organizational and analytical skills; an ability to think broadly and to ask questions about data, facts and other information to deliver quality to our clients 
  Share and collaborate effectively with others, building relationships which are genuine and rooted in trust 
  Ability to easily adapt and prioritize, demonstrating project management skills to handle changing priorities 
 
 
  Examples of alignment with PwC Values: Acting with Integrity, Working Together, Care, Reimagine the Possible and Make a Difference 
  You’ll be comfortable travelling to cities across Canada (when deemed safe to do so by applicable public health or regulatory authorities and PwC) 
  This role requires that you are legally entitled to work for PwC in Canada for the intended duration of the offer/contract. 
  We'd love it even more if you’re bilingual in English and French, however this isn't a requirement.

Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. In May 2011, Microsoft Corporation acquired Skype Communications for $8.5 billion dollars.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/88813b3f866a5b58c9685073e3b87e05","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Microsoft","4.2","8385","http://www.microsoft.com/","Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

"Microsoft","Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is an American public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. In May 2011, Microsoft Corporation acquired Skype Communications for $8.5 billion dollars.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/88813b3f866a5b58c9685073e3b87e05","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Microsoft","4.2","8385","http://www.microsoft.com/","Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

"Microsoft","Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is an American public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. In May 2011, Microsoft Corporation acquired Skype Communications for $8.5 billion dollars.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/88813b3f866a5b58c9685073e3b87e05","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Microsoft","4.2","8385","http://www.microsoft.com/","Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

"Relay Financial",,,"https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Relay-Financial","4","1",,"Our mission is to increase the success rate of small businesses. Traditional banking has been a growth limiter rather than a growth enabler for business owners, and we’re changing that. Relay is the all-in-one, collaborative money management platform. We’re building for employer SMBs and their finance function, internal and external, and are focused on delivering a human-centric customer experience. Ultimately, we help SMBs be ‘on the money'.
 
 
 
   Relay is entering an exciting new chapter of growth. We’re looking for a Customer Experience Co-op to join one of our largest teams at Relay. This is a unique opportunity to support our growing customer base and become a product knowledge expert in all things Relay and Fintech.
 
 
 
   In this role, you will have the opportunity to communicate directly with our customers through online queries and calls and flex your writing skills by creating helpful resources for customers. You're a creative problem solver with deep empathy for helping shape the future of small businesses. You will act as the face of Relay to our customers; this is some of our most important work. If you are solution-oriented, enjoy being resourceful, and have deep empathy for customers (and like to work with a fun team!); come join us!
  
 What You’ll Be Doing:
 
   Deliver world-class customer support by answering incoming inquiries quickly, honestly, and helpfully
   Prioritize the customer experience by taking opportunities to build meaningful connections with customers that go beyond small talk (show interest in the customer and their business)
   Prioritize tasks and customer needs while working independently and autonomously
   Investigate and problem-solve together with team members from Engineering, Sales, Product, and beyond to troubleshoot customer issues and get results in a timely manner
   Develop a comprehensive knowledge base that empowers customers to troubleshoot issues and easily find answers to questions
 
  Who You Are:
 
   You have 1+ years of experience working in customer support, success, or a customer-facing role
   You have strong written and verbal communication skills, with the desire to grow and develop this further
   You have a team-first mentality and take opportunities to share learnings and learn from your fellow team members
   You have deep empathy for customers and balance being resourceful and direct with customers
   You have fine-tuned prioritization skills to maximize your impact
   You have the ability to rise to a challenge; you can handle change and uncertainty, at times
   You are naturally curious, you love to understand the “why” behind a problem or question and aren’t afraid to dig deep into problem-solving
 
 
 
   Bonus Points
 
 
   You have experience working with customer support tools or ticketing systems (Zendesk or similar)
   You have prior tech start-up experience or worked in a fast-paced environment
 
  Our Commitment To You:
 
   The expected pay range for this position is $18/hr to $20/hr. Actual pay will be determined based on several factors such as past experience and qualifications, geographic location, and other job-related factors permitted by law.
   Hybrid work environment: we love collaborating and connecting in office two times a week and offer bi-weekly catered lunches and a snack/beverage program for the days we’re in office. For the days we spend at home, you will need a dedicated and private room to conduct your work confidentially.
   Personal and professional growth: support from leaders who care about your growth and success through regular feedback and coaching. Our goal is to make Relay a step-change co-op opportunity.
   Top-tier equipment: we’ll make sure you have everything you need to produce your best work.
   Team-first culture: we’re passionate about working collaboratively, bonding through team events, and most importantly having fun.
 
  The Interview Process:
 
   Stage 1: A short writing sample about customer experience
   Stage 2: A 45-minute Google Meets video call with our Customer Experience Leads
   Stage 3: A 30-minute Google Meets video call with members of our Customer Experience team
 
  The Practicals:
 
   Reports to: Team Lead / Sr. Customer Experience Specialist
   Duration: May 6th 2024 - August 23rd 2024
   Employment type: Full-time Co-op
   Work Location: Remote. 
  Possible weekend and holiday shifts
 
 
   Research shows that women-identifying and other marginalized individuals tend to only apply when they meet 100% of the qualifications; if you don't have all the listed qualifications, we encourage you to apply anyway!

 The transition towards a hydrogen-based energy system is pivotal for achieving decarbonization goals. However, this transition is encumbered by significant challenges, particularly in terms of making hydrogen both accessible and affordable at a scale comparable to fossil fuels. A critical yet often overlooked obstacle is the deficiency of sophisticated modeling tools, which are essential for understanding and navigating the complexities of hydrogen systems. This project delineates the multifaceted challenges inherent in the widespread adoption of hydrogen and underscores the necessity for comprehensive modeling frameworks. 
 We will collaborate with our industry partner, Teralta Hydrogen Solutions Inc., to create an industry-representative simulation model that provides necessary data for the techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) used for understanding the financial and environmental implications of a given design of a H2 production and distribution system. Such an understanding is critical for making an informed decision with respect to scaling up a H2 system. The methodology and resulting modeling framework (i.e., process simulation + LCA +TEA) will be made publicly available through a technical report (and potentially a peer-reviewed journal publication), public data repositions, and tutorial videos, which will ensure a broad impact of this project to benefit both researchers and industrial practitioners aiming to promote the scaling of H2 systems. 
 Project Objectives 
 The general objective of this project is to develop a streamlined modeling framework for estimating the financial and environmental benefits of accelerating the adoption of hydrogen at commercial scale. The resulting framework can identify opportunities for cost reduction and explore alternative sourcing options, ensuring that hydrogen production remains cost-competitive and environmentally responsible. 
 We will co-develop the framework with various departments within Teralta, including engineering, procurement, and project management to incorporate the best industrial practices to achieve cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and quality assurance. 
 Project Deliverables 
 
  A process simulation model that can be customized to calculate the material and energy balances for a given environmental impact for a given scenario of H2 production and distribution. 
  A TEA model that can be customized to calculate the cos-efficiency and other economic metrics (e.g., net present value) for a given scenario of H2 production and distribution. 
  An LCA model that can be customized to calculate the environmental impacts for a given scenario of H2 production and distribution. 
  A Python-based analytical platform that integrates the TEA and LCA calculations 
  A technical report that documents the data and methodology of the models created from this project 
 
 Position Details 
 Supervisor: Prof. Qingshi Tu, Department of Wood Science, Faculty of Forestry Start Date: As soon as possible. This position will last for 1 year. Compensation: Around the typical PhD RAship level. You can inquire with Siduo Zhang when you apply. 
 Qualifications 
 
  Must be a currently registered full-time PhD student at UBC 
  Background and research field is related to the topic of this project 
  Experience and skills in process simulation model, TEA model, and LCA model 
  Strong research skills, communication skills, and academic writing skills

    Job Description:
    Data Engineer Internship
    Demonware (Activision), Vancouver
    May 2024
   
    Interns will be required to be onsite at the Demonware Vancouver office following the team's work schedule (hybrid, 3 days a week), a relocation package may be offered depending on eligibility.
     The Company
    Demonware is a member of the Activision family of studios. We work alongside engineers and creatives at our AAA partner studios and deliver the online and data services required by our franchises. We craft, develop, and host services for some of the world’s biggest video game franchises, including Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot.
   
    We are a technology company and dedicated to openness. This means collaborating to tackle problems, the freedom to talk to anyone, and the best idea wins. We take the work seriously; ourselves, not so much!
   
    We’re open to work terms of 8+ months. If you just graduated, we still want to hear from you!
   
    The Team
    Demonware's data team is responsible for creating the services and infrastructure that ingest the billions of events our games emit each day. At this scale, the challenges we face empower our engineers to flex their creative engineering muscles. When we get things right the analysts, studios and developers that interact with our systems can rapidly go from question to insight without ever having to talk to us.
    The Demonware data team also works with studios to model and instrument the things that matter. We work with our customers to ship data forward applications, ensure compliance of data produced and oversee the quality throughout.
   
    Big company challenges, small company culture
    Demonware hosts millions of concurrently connected users. Some of the technologies we use are Python, Linux, MySQL, C++, and Erlang. We solve tough problems on a day-to-day basis, and interns have a huge impact on what we do. We’ve had interns produce code and have it running in production within the first three days of joining.
   
    The Role
   
     Design, develop, and support scalable and efficient data applications, tools and frameworks
     Assist in developing solutions around our big data platforms using technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Spark-Streaming, Flink, Beam, and others
     Development of APIs & microservices to access, transform and deliver analytics data
     Collaborate closely with other engineers on the data team who are responsible for managing various aspects of our data footprint including data instrumentation, ingestion, streaming, processing, transformation, and visualization
     Creating tools to automate all the things!
   
   
    Requirements
   
     Comfortable with one or more computer programming languages (Python, Scala, Java, Kotlin, etc.)
     Understanding of SQL based and relational databases
     A good grasp of fundamental algorithms and data structures
     Excellent debugging and analytical skills
     Passion for working with big data technologies
     Interest in the data creation lifecycle, from 1's and 0's to driving business decisions
     Can identify complex problems and find simple solutions
    
     
      Can clearly communicate technical concepts in plain English
     
   
   
    Nice-to-haves
   
     Linux/Unix command line and scripting knowledge
     Experience with distributed software development (scalability, efficiency)
     Experience working with Big Data (Kafka, PubSub, Spark, Presto, Flink, Beam, etc.)
     Experience working with AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud
     Experience with CI/CD, unit and integration testing, orchestration and containerization tools e.g. GitHub, Jenkins, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, etc
   
   
    Please list any additional experience you have with Linux at home, any programming-related hobbies and resulting projects, any exciting school assignments you worked on, any open-source involvement and a link to your code repository and/or blog.
   
    Perks
   
     Complimentary breakfast, lunch, and drinks from a fully stocked kitchen
     BBQs and Lunch & Learns
     City-center office location
     Vacation allowance
     Competitive pay
     Free games
   
   
    How to Apply
    You can apply directly through your Coop office or directly apply at demonware.net
   
    If you are not applying through your school program, please submit your resume, cover letter (optional but preferred) and a copy of your most recent school transcripts.
   
    We love hearing from anyone who is enthusiastic about changing the games industry. Not sure you meet all qualifications? Let us decide! Research shows that women and members of other under-represented groups tend to not apply to jobs when they think they may not meet every qualification, when, in fact, they often do! At Activision Blizzard, we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and strongly encourage you to apply
    Rewards
    We provide a suite of benefits that promote physical, emotional and financial well-being for ‘Every World’ - we’ve got our employees covered! Subject to eligibility requirements, the Company offers comprehensive benefits including:
   
     Medical, dental, vision, health savings account or health reimbursement account, healthcare spending accounts, dependent care spending accounts, life and AD&D insurance, disability insurance;

"Uline","In 1980, Liz and Dick Uihlein recognized a local need for a shipping supply distributor and started Uline from their basement. Their first product was the H-101 carton sizer (still offered today). From those humble beginnings, the business has grown far beyond their expectations, while still remaining a family-owned and run company.

"Hill & Knowlton","Public relations firm Hill & Knowlton has ridden its reputation as a straight-shooter straight to the top. The company (whose founder John W. Hill emphasized the importance of dealing honestly and openly with the press) is one of the largest PR firms in the US and a part of advertising conglomerate WPP Group. Hill & Knowlton's services range from marketing communications to corporate reputation management to political lobbying. With almost 80 offices spanning some 45 countries, it caters to the technology and health industries; Lobbying firm Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates and Finnish unit Hill and Knowlton Finland Oy act as subsidiaries for Hill & Knowlton.

In early 2011, WPP officially merged Hill & Knowlton with Texas-based Public Strategies, another PR consultancy it owned. Public Strategies has more than a dozen offices in the US and Mexico. The deal gave Hill & Knowlton a more significant presence in the important US market and enhanced its expertise in the public affairs, research, and financial sectors. Each company retained its brand identity after the merger.

The agency has been focused on expanding into China. In early 2008, Hill & Knowlton bought a 70% stake in Rikes Communications, a PR firm based in Hong Kong. The deal brought a sizeable amount of Chinese clients to Hill & Knowlton's customer base. The agency also acquired a majority interest in Synergy, its South Korean partner. In mid-2009, Hill & Knowlton added to its operations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou when it launched an office in Chengdu, a major city in western China that the agency considers to be a region ripe for economic growth.

During that same time period, the company expanded its presence into Africa, another region the firm considers an emerging market, by establishing a joint venture with holding company Scangroup Limited. The joint venture, Hill & Knowlton East Africa Ltd, offers public relations expertise throughout Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.

Hill & Knowlton was acquired by WPP Group in 1987 through the purchase of J. Walter Thompson (now JWT). Hill & Knowlton was founded in 1927.",,"https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Hill-&-Knowlton","4.2","20","http://www.hillandknowlton.com","About Hill & Knowlton
