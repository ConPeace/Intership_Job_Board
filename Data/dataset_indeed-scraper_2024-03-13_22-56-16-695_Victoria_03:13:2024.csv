"WildPlay","In 2006, the seeds of aerial adventure were planted by WildPlay Ltd. co-founders Gord Ross and Tom Benson. As avid climbers and certified guides, paragliding pilots, and nature enthusiasts, the businessmen were eager to share their passion - and belief in life-changing outdoor adventures - with people from every walk of life.

With 15-years of professional guiding experience, Ross and Benson had witnessed all manner of personal evolution when people connected with the outdoors. Every mountain scaled and hillside crossed seemed to result in guests uncovering new abilities and self-confidence. The desire to help more people overcome self-perceived boundaries was strong; however, they were limited by the intimidating requirements and high level of commitment that came along with climbing-type activities.

A solution to limited access sprouted when Ross discovered ""tree-to-tree"" parks in Europe and South America. Through research and product-testing, the pair realized that suspended obstacles and games could deliver a challenging and personal outdoor experience to adults, teens, and kids, without the steep learning curve. Coining their idea the ""Monkido® Aerial Adventure"", the entrepreneurs knew they had found the way to unleash outdoor recreation.

Park development came next, and the co-founders knew that the right location would not only showcase Mother Nature, but would respect and champion her health. They established development and operations criteria that include innovative Element design techniques, high standards for minimizing or improving environmental impact, sensitive building practices, and careful site selection that continue as markers of their expanding list of Park locations today.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/c1760ce00b9887561b2be49e77604155","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Wildplay-Element-Parks-2","3.8","62","https://www.wildplay.com/","This is a temporary 4 month or 8 month co-op position intended for a student in university/college to gain work experience.
