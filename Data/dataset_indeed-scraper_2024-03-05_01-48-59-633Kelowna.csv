"Burrowing Owl Estate Winery","Located near the north end of Osoyoos Lake in BC’s fabled Okanagan Valley, Burrowing Owl Estate Winery is devoted to crafting world-class wines in an environmentally-sustainable manner. Founder Jim Wyse has always had a strong commitment to striving for balance in all things, and this philosophy infuses everything that’s done at Burrowing Owl, from viticulture to winemaking. In the vineyard, the natural balance is maintained by recruiting bluebirds and bats to help control harmful insects; at the winemaking facilities, state-of-the-art technology is employed along with traditional winemaking methods. Remarkable for its strikingly beautiful setting as well as its environmental leadership, the winery has become a destination for wine lovers around the globe: every year Burrowing Owl welcomes over 100,000 visitors at its Wine Shop, Sonora Room Restaurant, and Guest House. Burrowing Owl’s success has also benefited our feathered friends, as the winery supports conservation work that is helping its namesake, the endangered burrowing owl, make a comeback in British Columbia.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/cf760484cd18576dbcc9494f6609028b","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Burrowing-Owl-Vineyards-Ltd.-1","3.4","9","https://www.burrowingowlwine.ca/","Housekeeper

Be part of the next great story in wine!
Mission Hill Family Estate:
Over 40 years ago, we founded our family winery with an audacious dream – to redefine what’s possible for Canadian wine in the eyes of the world. With a deep commitment to the Okanagan region, and a relentless passion to produce wines that can stand alongside the best in the world, our wines are crafted with bold precision and an uncompromising respect for the diverse vineyards and micro-climates here.
Our Culture:
Our culture is unapologetically fast paced, entrepreneurial, and results driven. Each team member is a storyteller and makes an impact on a family-owned business that is building a lasting legacy in the Canadian and International wine industry. Our people have relentless drive to always raise the bar, a genuine entrepreneurial spirit, a passion, and love for what we do, to all act like owners, and to constantly innovate.

Your Culinary Journey:

From farm tours to food and wine tastings, we strive to ensure our team acquires the knowledge and appreciation of the valley and the winery needed to surpass our guests’ expectations. Each team member will have the opportunity to hone their culinary skills and develop professional relationships that will last a lifetime while working with our accomplished and celebrated culinary team.

Authenticity

 We need to stay real because our brands, our stories and our culture must remain genuine to thrive.
 When we have the best intentions for all, we create space to be our whole selves and do great things together.

Simplicity

 Our lives are complicated enough. So why use 50 words when you can use 5?
