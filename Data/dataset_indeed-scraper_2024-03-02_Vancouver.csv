"Microsoft","Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is an American public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. In May 2011, Microsoft Corporation acquired Skype Communications for $8.5 billion dollars.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/88813b3f866a5b58c9685073e3b87e05","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Microsoft","4.2","8370","http://www.microsoft.com/","Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

"Microsoft","Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is an American public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. In May 2011, Microsoft Corporation acquired Skype Communications for $8.5 billion dollars.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/88813b3f866a5b58c9685073e3b87e05","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Microsoft","4.2","8370","http://www.microsoft.com/","Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

"Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Our ""about us"" is really about you.
We have always been a different kind of financial services firm, embracing long-term planning, valuing methodical decision-making and remaining focused on what matters most: You.

About Us 
When Bob James founded Raymond James, he did so based on a belief that clients deserved more than help with investment decisions, they needed advice that considered their entire financial picture.

Today, that client-focused approach has extended to serve client accounts through 8,100 financial advisors in the United States, Canada and overseas. Further, the company has expanded through the years to serve corporations, institutions and municipalities through significant capital markets, banking and asset management services.

No matter the business, we believe if we do what’s right for clients,
we’ll help them achieve success while also realizing our own.
It’s that simple.

Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.

We work alongside engineers and creatives at our AAA partner studios and deliver the online and data services required by our franchises. We craft, develop, and host services for some of the world’s biggest video game franchises, including Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot.
   
    We are a technology company and dedicated to openness. This means collaborating to tackle problems, the freedom to talk to anyone, and the best idea wins. We take the work seriously; ourselves, not so much!
   
    We’re open to work terms of 8+ months. If you just graduated, we still want to hear from you!
   
    The Team
    Demonware's data team is responsible for creating the services and infrastructure that ingest the billions of events our games emit each day. At this scale, the challenges we face empower our engineers to flex their creative engineering muscles. When we get things right the analysts, studios and developers that interact with our systems can rapidly go from question to insight without ever having to talk to us.
    The Demonware data team also works with studios to model and instrument the things that matter. We work with our customers to ship data forward applications, ensure compliance of data produced and oversee the quality throughout.
   
    Big company challenges, small company culture
    Demonware hosts millions of concurrently connected users. Some of the technologies we use are Python, Linux, MySQL, C++, and Erlang. We solve tough problems on a day-to-day basis, and interns have a huge impact on what we do. We’ve had interns produce code and have it running in production within the first three days of joining.
   
    The Role
   
     Design, develop, and support scalable and efficient data applications, tools and frameworks
     Assist in developing solutions around our big data platforms using technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Spark-Streaming, Flink, Beam, and others

     Understanding of SQL based and relational databases
     A good grasp of fundamental algorithms and data structures
     Excellent debugging and analytical skills
     Passion for working with big data technologies
     Interest in the data creation lifecycle, from 1's and 0's to driving business decisions
     Can identify complex problems and find simple solutions
    
     
      Can clearly communicate technical concepts in plain English
     
   
   
    Nice-to-haves
   
     Linux/Unix command line and scripting knowledge
     Experience with distributed software development (scalability, efficiency)
     Experience working with Big Data (Kafka, PubSub, Spark, Presto, Flink, Beam, etc.)
     Experience working with AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud
     Experience with CI/CD, unit and integration testing, orchestration and containerization tools e.g. GitHub, Jenkins, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, etc
   
   
    Please list any additional experience you have with Linux at home, any programming-related hobbies and resulting projects, any exciting school assignments you worked on, any open-source involvement and a link to your code repository and/or blog.

    We provide a suite of benefits that promote physical, emotional and financial well-being for ‘Every World’ - we’ve got our employees covered! Subject to eligibility requirements, the Company offers comprehensive benefits including:

 The transition towards a hydrogen-based energy system is pivotal for achieving decarbonization goals. However, this transition is encumbered by significant challenges, particularly in terms of making hydrogen both accessible and affordable at a scale comparable to fossil fuels. A critical yet often overlooked obstacle is the deficiency of sophisticated modeling tools, which are essential for understanding and navigating the complexities of hydrogen systems. This project delineates the multifaceted challenges inherent in the widespread adoption of hydrogen and underscores the necessity for comprehensive modeling frameworks. 
 We will collaborate with our industry partner, Teralta Hydrogen Solutions Inc., to create an industry-representative simulation model that provides necessary data for the techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) used for understanding the financial and environmental implications of a given design of a H2 production and distribution system. Such an understanding is critical for making an informed decision with respect to scaling up a H2 system. The methodology and resulting modeling framework (i.e., process simulation + LCA +TEA) will be made publicly available through a technical report (and potentially a peer-reviewed journal publication), public data repositions, and tutorial videos, which will ensure a broad impact of this project to benefit both researchers and industrial practitioners aiming to promote the scaling of H2 systems. 
 Project Objectives 
 The general objective of this project is to develop a streamlined modeling framework for estimating the financial and environmental benefits of accelerating the adoption of hydrogen at commercial scale. The resulting framework can identify opportunities for cost reduction and explore alternative sourcing options, ensuring that hydrogen production remains cost-competitive and environmentally responsible. 
 We will co-develop the framework with various departments within Teralta, including engineering, procurement, and project management to incorporate the best industrial practices to achieve cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and quality assurance. 
 Project Deliverables 
 
  A process simulation model that can be customized to calculate the material and energy balances for a given environmental impact for a given scenario of H2 production and distribution. 
  A TEA model that can be customized to calculate the cos-efficiency and other economic metrics (e.g., net present value) for a given scenario of H2 production and distribution. 
  An LCA model that can be customized to calculate the environmental impacts for a given scenario of H2 production and distribution. 
  A Python-based analytical platform that integrates the TEA and LCA calculations 
  A technical report that documents the data and methodology of the models created from this project 
 
 Position Details 
 Supervisor: Prof. Qingshi Tu, Department of Wood Science, Faculty of Forestry Start Date: As soon as possible. This position will last for 1 year. Compensation: Around the typical PhD RAship level. You can inquire with Siduo Zhang when you apply. 
 Qualifications 
 
  Must be a currently registered full-time PhD student at UBC 
  Background and research field is related to the topic of this project 
  Experience and skills in process simulation model, TEA model, and LCA model 
  Strong research skills, communication skills, and academic writing skills 
  Self-motivated, can work well independently and on a team

    The Company 
   Demonware is a member of the Activision family of studios. We work alongside engineers and creatives at our AAA partner studios and deliver the online and data services required by our franchises. We craft, develop, and host services for some of the world’s biggest video game franchises, including Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot.
   
    We are a technology company and dedicated to openness. This means collaborating to tackle problems, the freedom to talk to anyone, and the best idea wins. We take the work seriously; ourselves, not so much!
   
    We’re open to work terms of 8+ months. If you just graduated, we still want to hear from you!
   
    Big company challenges, small company culture
    Demonware hosts millions of concurrently connected users. Some of the technologies we use are Python, Linux, MySQL, C++, and Erlang. We solve tough problems on a day-to-day basis, and interns have a huge impact on what we do. We’ve had interns produce code and have it running in production within the first three days of joining.
   
    The role:
    As a Front-End Developer Intern at Activision, you will work within the Experience Optimization group to build innovative and impactful websites. You’ll develop experience building responsive websites using HTML, Javascript and CSS.
   
    Key responsibilities include:
   
     Build, update, and maintain different types of websites including marketing (ex, callofduty.com) and corporate (ex, Activision.com).
     Build sites that can be authored by non-technical resources within the Activision CMS (Adobe AEM).
     Create reusable code for future use.
     Collaborate with website stakeholders, project managers, QA and UX/UI designers to ensure deliverables are met.
     Work in a collaborative environment with some pretty cool people.
   
   
    Requirements:
   
     Proficient with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
     Ability to use APIs to create dynamic websites.
     Able to create responsive websites without the use of libraries such as Bootstrap.
     Great organization skills and ability to work in a fast paced environment.
     Strong problem-solving and troubleshooting skills.
     Able to work independently with little oversight.
     Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
     Embrace emerging standards while promoting best practices in order to push the limits of what a browser can do.
   
   
    Perks 
   
    Complimentary breakfast, lunch, and drinks from a fully stocked kitchen
     BBQs and Lunch & Learns
     City-center office location
     Vacation allowance
     Competitive pay
     Free games

    You can apply directly through your Coop office or directly apply at demonware.net
   
    If you are not applying through your school program, please submit your resume, cover letter (optional but preferred) and a copy of your most recent school transcripts.
   
    We love hearing from anyone who is enthusiastic about changing the games industry. Not sure you meet all qualifications? Let us decide! Research shows that women and members of other under-represented groups tend to not apply to jobs when they think they may not meet every qualification, when, in fact, they often do! At Activision Blizzard, we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and strongly encourage you to apply

"Hill & Knowlton","Public relations firm Hill & Knowlton has ridden its reputation as a straight-shooter straight to the top. The company (whose founder John W. Hill emphasized the importance of dealing honestly and openly with the press) is one of the largest PR firms in the US and a part of advertising conglomerate WPP Group. Hill & Knowlton's services range from marketing communications to corporate reputation management to political lobbying. With almost 80 offices spanning some 45 countries, it caters to the technology and health industries; Lobbying firm Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates and Finnish unit Hill and Knowlton Finland Oy act as subsidiaries for Hill & Knowlton.

In early 2011, WPP officially merged Hill & Knowlton with Texas-based Public Strategies, another PR consultancy it owned. Public Strategies has more than a dozen offices in the US and Mexico. The deal gave Hill & Knowlton a more significant presence in the important US market and enhanced its expertise in the public affairs, research, and financial sectors. Each company retained its brand identity after the merger.

The agency has been focused on expanding into China. In early 2008, Hill & Knowlton bought a 70% stake in Rikes Communications, a PR firm based in Hong Kong. The deal brought a sizeable amount of Chinese clients to Hill & Knowlton's customer base. The agency also acquired a majority interest in Synergy, its South Korean partner. In mid-2009, Hill & Knowlton added to its operations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou when it launched an office in Chengdu, a major city in western China that the agency considers to be a region ripe for economic growth.

During that same time period, the company expanded its presence into Africa, another region the firm considers an emerging market, by establishing a joint venture with holding company Scangroup Limited. The joint venture, Hill & Knowlton East Africa Ltd, offers public relations expertise throughout Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.

Hill & Knowlton was acquired by WPP Group in 1987 through the purchase of J. Walter Thompson (now JWT). Hill & Knowlton was founded in 1927.",,"https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Hill-&-Knowlton","4.2","20","http://www.hillandknowlton.com","About Hill & Knowlton

We’re committed to partnering with our clients to ensure things turn out exactly the way they want them – the first time – without cutting corners. Ask anyone who’s worked with Axiom and they’ll say the same thing.

KEEP OUR WORD. ALWAYS.
In the early days, our contracts were sealed with little more than a handshake – the same goes today. Axiom’s reputation for honesty and fair dealing is well deserved, and we work hard every day to maintain that.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/06da86610ad935cb28d3c9e5bb7d5727","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Axiom-Builders","3.6","18","http://www.axiombuilders.ca","About The Company:

"United Rentals, Inc.","No cash to buy a bulldozer? No worries -- just lease one from United Rentals. The company considers itself the #1 commercial and construction equipment renter in the world, serving customers in the commercial, infrastructure, industrial, and residential sectors. It operates through a network of more than 970 locations in the US and Canada, and provides about 3,000 equipment items -- everything from general to heavy construction and industrial equipment to hand tools, special-event items (such as aerial towers), power (diesel generators) and HVAC equipment, and trench-safety equipment. It also sells new and used equipment, as well as rental-related and contractor supplies and parts. 

In 2012 United Rentals increased its outlet count from more than 530 to more than 970 after it bought rival RSC Holdings in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $4.2 billion, or $18 per share, including $2.3 billion in debt. Both companies have suffered from the recession and combining the two will save more than $200 million a year by eliminating redundant infrastructure, branches, and overhead. The combined businesses will also be in a more strategic position for serving industrial customers.

Before the acquisition, United Rentals held about a 9% market share in the US construction/industrial equipment rental industry. It counts commercial construction as its largest end-market, representing about 54% of its rental revenues. The company's general rentals operations cover seven geographic regions throughout the US and northeast Canada. United Rentals expanded its Canadian operations in 2011 with two acquisitions, first buying Venetor Group, a rental equipment company with seven locations in Ontario, and then Ontario Laser Rentals, a lessor of trench safety equipment with two locations in Ontario and one in Montreal.

Revenue rose about 17% in 2011 compared with 2010. Equipment rentals, accounting for 82% of revenue, surged 17% while the company's next largest segment, sales of rental equipment, 8% of revenue, soared 44%. Sales of new equipment increased 7%. Contractor supply sales and service and other revenue were down 10% and 3%, respectively. Equipment rentals did well behind an increase in the volume of original equipment cost on rent. An increase in rental rates also contributed. Sales of rental equipment were pushed up by increased volume, better pricing, and a new mix of equipment. After weathering a net loss of $62 million in 2009 and one of $26 million in 2010 amid a tough economy, United Rentals enjoyed a net income of $101 million in 2011 along with its strong sales uptick.

United Rentals enhances its operating efficiencies by ramping up through consolidation of functions, including payroll and accounts payable. In order to manage the age, composition and size of its fleet, the company routinely sells used rental equipment and invests in new equipment. United Rentals acts as a dealer of new equipment for many leading equipment makers such as Genie Industries, Skyjack (aerial lifts), Sullair (compressors), and Terex (telehandlers). At most branches United Rentals sells various supplies and merchandise and offers repair and maintenance services.

United Rentals has simultaneously beefed up its presence in the energy market. In late 2011 it purchased the assets of Blue Mountain Equipment Rental Corporation, which caters to the oil and gas industry working in the Marcellus Shale through two locations in Pennsylvania and one in West Virginia. Earlier that year it bought GulfStar Rental Solutions, a power and HVAC equipment rental company in the south. GulfStar adds three locations in Texas and Louisiana, deepening its customer base along the Gulf Coast, as well as paving the way for cross-marketing its general and aerial rental portfolio. 

Although United Rentals' customers range from FORTUNE 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners, it targets larger customers, which tend to rent for longer terms and are timely in payment. Because of its size, United Rentals rallies more resources over smaller businesses. Competitive advantages include more purchasing leverage, a wider range of equipment and services, and the more convenient movement of assets between locations. 

BlackRock, Inc. holds a stake of more than 10% in the rental business. The investment firm is among the world's most established financial advisors","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/ce70fe2c7eb8fe868be946a5d59f63b6","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/United-Rentals-a3e42836","3.6","1690","http://www.unitedrentals.com","Great company.

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.
 
 
 
   Who are we?
 
 
   Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day. 
 
 
  We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.
 
 
 
   We’re growing and currently looking to add a Content Analyst Intern to our team.
   
 
 
  
 
  Imagine being a seller running through several documents of facts and competitive intel to find how to depose a competitor while a prospect is grilling you with objections? Wouldn’t a central repository of all this information presented in the most actionable and digestible manner be a dream come true?
 
 
 
   As a content intern, your role would be to ensure our ever growing list of clients’ competitive content migrated to and hosted in Klue is following these best practices and optimized to ensure their sellers win more deals over competitors. You’ll get exposure to best practices for competitive content and ensure content is optimized for end-user consumption, supporting our customers like Dell, Adobe and Shopify. The role will include effectively communicating recommendations, training end-users, and monitoring third-party content for adherence to Klue's best practices.
 
 
 
   Klue is a collaborative company where we believe in the value that can be unlocked by sharing data insights across departments and clients - you'll be getting a full picture of how a SaaS company on a rocketship trajectory operates. You’ll have many opportunities to listen in on strategic conversations and will be encouraged to ask questions along the way. As the company grows, we will have many roles to fill within the CS department and would hope the right candidate would consider returning one day.
  
 This is you:
 
   You enjoy writing and are a strong writer
   Highly analytical and critical thinker
   You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
   Ability to digest complex data and identify trends
   Creative problem solver
   High attention to detail
   Strong communicator and team player
 
  Bonus points for...
 
   Experience working in SaaS, Sales, Marketing or Content creation positions.
 
  What you'll be measured on:
 
   Ability to quickly ramp on new technologies.
   Efficiency in content transformation and migration.
 
  How We Work at Klue:
 
   Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our team is located in EST and PST. Ideally, this role would be located in Vancouver. Your team will be in office at least 2 days per week, if you are within a reasonable commuting distance of the office, we’ll see you there!
 
 
   We gather compensation benchmarking data across the BC & Canadian Tech Industry and use that data to build a range for our current team and future talent. Your exact salary is determined by experience level, skill, capabilities, and internal pay parity.
 
 
 
   If you feel like this role is a great fit and have questions about comp, get in touch and we’re happy to discuss further. There is always an ongoing conversation around compensation.
 
 
   Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.
 
 
 
   We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.
 
 
 
   All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

 Currently enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program with all requirements anticipated to be completed between December 2024 and August 2025 
 If you are eager to be involved in continuing to define the future of online retail, and are an organized self-starter, apply to join our team in Amazon Operations as a Fulfillment Area Manager Intern! Amazon provides training and development for Fulfillment Area Manager Interns to become exceptional people leaders. 

 Amazon is looking for bright leaders to lead large teams of Amazon Associates across our cutting-edge fulfillment network! This is not a corporate, office-based position. This is a ten-week internship (40 hours per week) during the summer of 2024 located within one of our Amazon fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery stations or other operations buildings within the Amazon Fulfillment Network. Amazon provides extensive training and development for entry level managers to become exceptional people leaders. 

 Being an Area Manager Intern means being on the front lines of our customer promise, ensuring your team delivers customers’ orders on time, by leading a large team of Amazon Associates in one of our fulfillment locations. You will have an opportunity to invest in others and develop a collaborative leadership style, while utilizing the tools, processes, and operations that have helped create the most customer-centric company on Earth. 

 What is fulfillment you ask? Fulfillment is how we refer to completing or fulfilling a customer’s Amazon.com order and the acts of picking, packing, shipping and delivering their order to meet or exceed their expectations! Our Operation’s workflow can be broken to three major lanes: first mile - where the product is housed and ready for your order; second mile - where your order is hauled to your area; and last mile - when the product is delivered to your door. Please note that all lanes have slight building variations, but one thing is constant, our vision and dedication to the customer. As a reminder, our fulfillment centers are fast paced environments where standing, walking, and having on-the-production floor conversations are common as a visible supply chain leader! 

 Program Quick Facts and Location:
 
 
 This position is not a corporate role or in an office setting. This position is interactive, on-the-floor with your team and will be located in a fulfillment center, sort center, delivery station, or other building within the Amazon Fulfillment Network.

</ul> If you are eager to be involved in continuing to define the future of online retail, and are an organized self-starter, apply to join our team in Amazon Operations as a Fulfillment Area Manager Intern! Amazon provides training and development for Fulfillment Area Manager Interns to become exceptional people leaders. 
<br>
<br> Amazon is looking for bright leaders to lead large teams of Amazon Associates across our cutting-edge fulfillment network! This is not a corporate, office-based position. This is a ten-week internship (40 hours per week) during the summer of 2024 located within one of our Amazon fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery stations or other operations buildings within the Amazon Fulfillment Network. Amazon provides extensive training and development for entry level managers to become exceptional people leaders.

You will have an opportunity to invest in others and develop a collaborative leadership style, while utilizing the tools, processes, and operations that have helped create the most customer-centric company on Earth. 
<br>
<br> What is fulfillment you ask? Fulfillment is how we refer to completing or fulfilling a customer&#x2019;s Amazon.com order and the acts of picking, packing, shipping and delivering their order to meet or exceed their expectations! Our Operation&#x2019;s workflow can be broken to three major lanes: first mile - where the product is housed and ready for your order; second mile - where your order is hauled to your area; and last mile - when the product is delivered to your door. Please note that all lanes have slight building variations, but one thing is constant, our vision and dedication to the customer. As a reminder, our fulfillment centers are fast paced environments where standing, walking, and having on-the-production floor conversations are common as a visible supply chain leader!
