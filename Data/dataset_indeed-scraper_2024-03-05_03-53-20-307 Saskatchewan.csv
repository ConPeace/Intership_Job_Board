"BHP","BHP is a world-leading resources company. Our corporate purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. We do this through our strategy: to have the best capabilities, best commodities and best assets, to create long-term value and high returns. We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal.

With more than 80,000 employees and contractors, working across 90 locations worldwide, our people sit at the very heart of everything we do. At BHP, we are focused on creating a safe workplace where our people feel connected to our values and objectives and where the capability of our people is key to our success.

True to our purpose, we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace; this commitment is embedded in Our Charter because we know it’s critical to our success. Local Inclusion and Diversity Council’s operate in our Asset’s and offices around the globe, following the same priorities. Our people are the driving force behind bringing our aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by 2025 to life. By aspiring for gender balance, we will create a safer, more harmonious culture. We want BHP to be a place where everyone is respected and valued and want it to be an enjoyable and inclusive place to work.

We're changing things up by asking everyone what their ‘flex’ looks like so we can create new definitions of flexibility where traditionally there has been none. We’ve found this to be the single biggest driver in helping us to promote greater workforce diversity – and that’s why it continues to be a key focus for BHP.

In addition to having the right assets in the right commodities, we also create value in the way we operate our assets. Our Operating Model allows us to leverage integrated systems and technology, replicate expertise and apply high standards of governance and transparency. 

We love new opinions and innovative ideas. It's the unique experiences and perspectives of our teams that will lead us into the future we're trying to create. We have tremendously talented people at BHP, but our teams are always looking for smarter and more agile ways of doing things to get there faster. Not to mention we have some great leaders here focused on supporting our next great leaders.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6b9c78e35a3e999b0b1d409bc6b47611","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Bhp-2","4.1","1199","https://www.bhp.com/careers","Date: 24 Feb 2024

  <b>About Potash</b>
 </div> 
 <div>
  The Jansen project in Saskatchewan, Canada is set to become one of the largest potash mines in the world and is located approximately 140 kilometers east of Saskatoon.
 </div>
 <br> 
 <div>
  <br> BHP&#x2019;s CAD&#x24;14 billion (US&#x24;10.5 billion) investment in the Jansen project will deliver a potash mine in Saskatchewan designed to maximize sustainability. As the largest investment in Saskatchewan&#x2019;s history, Jansen is expected to generate approximately 5,500 workforce opportunities during construction and 900 long-term roles.
 </div>
 <br> 
 <div>
  <br> Jansen&apos;s construction will take place over several years with first production planned for late 2026. Once fully ramped up, Jansen is expected to have an initial production capacity of approximately 8.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa), with the potential to produce 16 to 17 Mtpa in future stages.

"BHP","BHP is a world-leading resources company. Our corporate purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. We do this through our strategy: to have the best capabilities, best commodities and best assets, to create long-term value and high returns. We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal.

With more than 80,000 employees and contractors, working across 90 locations worldwide, our people sit at the very heart of everything we do. At BHP, we are focused on creating a safe workplace where our people feel connected to our values and objectives and where the capability of our people is key to our success.

True to our purpose, we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace; this commitment is embedded in Our Charter because we know it’s critical to our success. Local Inclusion and Diversity Council’s operate in our Asset’s and offices around the globe, following the same priorities. Our people are the driving force behind bringing our aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by 2025 to life. By aspiring for gender balance, we will create a safer, more harmonious culture. We want BHP to be a place where everyone is respected and valued and want it to be an enjoyable and inclusive place to work.

We're changing things up by asking everyone what their ‘flex’ looks like so we can create new definitions of flexibility where traditionally there has been none. We’ve found this to be the single biggest driver in helping us to promote greater workforce diversity – and that’s why it continues to be a key focus for BHP.

In addition to having the right assets in the right commodities, we also create value in the way we operate our assets. Our Operating Model allows us to leverage integrated systems and technology, replicate expertise and apply high standards of governance and transparency. 

We love new opinions and innovative ideas. It's the unique experiences and perspectives of our teams that will lead us into the future we're trying to create. We have tremendously talented people at BHP, but our teams are always looking for smarter and more agile ways of doing things to get there faster. Not to mention we have some great leaders here focused on supporting our next great leaders.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6b9c78e35a3e999b0b1d409bc6b47611","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Bhp-2","4.1","1199","https://www.bhp.com/careers","Date: 24 Feb 2024

"BHP","BHP is a world-leading resources company. Our corporate purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. We do this through our strategy: to have the best capabilities, best commodities and best assets, to create long-term value and high returns. We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal.

With more than 80,000 employees and contractors, working across 90 locations worldwide, our people sit at the very heart of everything we do. At BHP, we are focused on creating a safe workplace where our people feel connected to our values and objectives and where the capability of our people is key to our success.

True to our purpose, we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace; this commitment is embedded in Our Charter because we know it’s critical to our success. Local Inclusion and Diversity Council’s operate in our Asset’s and offices around the globe, following the same priorities. Our people are the driving force behind bringing our aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by 2025 to life. By aspiring for gender balance, we will create a safer, more harmonious culture. We want BHP to be a place where everyone is respected and valued and want it to be an enjoyable and inclusive place to work.

We're changing things up by asking everyone what their ‘flex’ looks like so we can create new definitions of flexibility where traditionally there has been none. We’ve found this to be the single biggest driver in helping us to promote greater workforce diversity – and that’s why it continues to be a key focus for BHP.

In addition to having the right assets in the right commodities, we also create value in the way we operate our assets. Our Operating Model allows us to leverage integrated systems and technology, replicate expertise and apply high standards of governance and transparency. 

We love new opinions and innovative ideas. It's the unique experiences and perspectives of our teams that will lead us into the future we're trying to create. We have tremendously talented people at BHP, but our teams are always looking for smarter and more agile ways of doing things to get there faster. Not to mention we have some great leaders here focused on supporting our next great leaders.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6b9c78e35a3e999b0b1d409bc6b47611","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Bhp-2","4.1","1199","https://www.bhp.com/careers","Date: 24 Feb 2024

"BHP","BHP is a world-leading resources company. Our corporate purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. We do this through our strategy: to have the best capabilities, best commodities and best assets, to create long-term value and high returns. We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal.

With more than 80,000 employees and contractors, working across 90 locations worldwide, our people sit at the very heart of everything we do. At BHP, we are focused on creating a safe workplace where our people feel connected to our values and objectives and where the capability of our people is key to our success.

True to our purpose, we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace; this commitment is embedded in Our Charter because we know it’s critical to our success. Local Inclusion and Diversity Council’s operate in our Asset’s and offices around the globe, following the same priorities. Our people are the driving force behind bringing our aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by 2025 to life. By aspiring for gender balance, we will create a safer, more harmonious culture. We want BHP to be a place where everyone is respected and valued and want it to be an enjoyable and inclusive place to work.

We're changing things up by asking everyone what their ‘flex’ looks like so we can create new definitions of flexibility where traditionally there has been none. We’ve found this to be the single biggest driver in helping us to promote greater workforce diversity – and that’s why it continues to be a key focus for BHP.

In addition to having the right assets in the right commodities, we also create value in the way we operate our assets. Our Operating Model allows us to leverage integrated systems and technology, replicate expertise and apply high standards of governance and transparency. 

We love new opinions and innovative ideas. It's the unique experiences and perspectives of our teams that will lead us into the future we're trying to create. We have tremendously talented people at BHP, but our teams are always looking for smarter and more agile ways of doing things to get there faster. Not to mention we have some great leaders here focused on supporting our next great leaders.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6b9c78e35a3e999b0b1d409bc6b47611","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Bhp-2","4.1","1199","https://www.bhp.com/careers","Date: 24 Feb 2024

"BHP","BHP is a world-leading resources company. Our corporate purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. We do this through our strategy: to have the best capabilities, best commodities and best assets, to create long-term value and high returns. We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal.

With more than 80,000 employees and contractors, working across 90 locations worldwide, our people sit at the very heart of everything we do. At BHP, we are focused on creating a safe workplace where our people feel connected to our values and objectives and where the capability of our people is key to our success.

True to our purpose, we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace; this commitment is embedded in Our Charter because we know it’s critical to our success. Local Inclusion and Diversity Council’s operate in our Asset’s and offices around the globe, following the same priorities. Our people are the driving force behind bringing our aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by 2025 to life. By aspiring for gender balance, we will create a safer, more harmonious culture. We want BHP to be a place where everyone is respected and valued and want it to be an enjoyable and inclusive place to work.

We're changing things up by asking everyone what their ‘flex’ looks like so we can create new definitions of flexibility where traditionally there has been none. We’ve found this to be the single biggest driver in helping us to promote greater workforce diversity – and that’s why it continues to be a key focus for BHP.

In addition to having the right assets in the right commodities, we also create value in the way we operate our assets. Our Operating Model allows us to leverage integrated systems and technology, replicate expertise and apply high standards of governance and transparency. 

We love new opinions and innovative ideas. It's the unique experiences and perspectives of our teams that will lead us into the future we're trying to create. We have tremendously talented people at BHP, but our teams are always looking for smarter and more agile ways of doing things to get there faster. Not to mention we have some great leaders here focused on supporting our next great leaders.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6b9c78e35a3e999b0b1d409bc6b47611","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Bhp-2","4.1","1199","https://www.bhp.com/careers","Date: 24 Feb 2024

  About Potash
  
 
  The Jansen project in Saskatchewan, Canada is set to become one of the largest potash mines in the world and is located approximately 140 kilometers east of Saskatoon.

As the largest investment in Saskatchewan’s history, Jansen is expected to generate approximately 5,500 workforce opportunities during construction and 900 long-term roles.
 
  
 
   Jansen's construction will take place over several years with first production planned for late 2026. Once fully ramped up, Jansen is expected to have an initial production capacity of approximately 8.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa), with the potential to produce 16 to 17 Mtpa in future stages.

We're changing things up by asking everyone what their ‘flex’ looks like so we can create new definitions of flexibility where traditionally there has been none. We’ve found this to be the single biggest driver in helping us to promote greater workforce diversity – and that’s why it continues to be a key focus for BHP.

In addition to having the right assets in the right commodities, we also create value in the way we operate our assets. Our Operating Model allows us to leverage integrated systems and technology, replicate expertise and apply high standards of governance and transparency. 

We love new opinions and innovative ideas. It's the unique experiences and perspectives of our teams that will lead us into the future we're trying to create. We have tremendously talented people at BHP, but our teams are always looking for smarter and more agile ways of doing things to get there faster. Not to mention we have some great leaders here focused on supporting our next great leaders.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6b9c78e35a3e999b0b1d409bc6b47611","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Bhp-2","4.1","1199","https://www.bhp.com/careers","Date: 24 Feb 2024

"BHP","BHP is a world-leading resources company. Our corporate purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. We do this through our strategy: to have the best capabilities, best commodities and best assets, to create long-term value and high returns. We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal.

With more than 80,000 employees and contractors, working across 90 locations worldwide, our people sit at the very heart of everything we do. At BHP, we are focused on creating a safe workplace where our people feel connected to our values and objectives and where the capability of our people is key to our success.

True to our purpose, we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace; this commitment is embedded in Our Charter because we know it’s critical to our success. Local Inclusion and Diversity Council’s operate in our Asset’s and offices around the globe, following the same priorities. Our people are the driving force behind bringing our aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by 2025 to life. By aspiring for gender balance, we will create a safer, more harmonious culture. We want BHP to be a place where everyone is respected and valued and want it to be an enjoyable and inclusive place to work.

We're changing things up by asking everyone what their ‘flex’ looks like so we can create new definitions of flexibility where traditionally there has been none. We’ve found this to be the single biggest driver in helping us to promote greater workforce diversity – and that’s why it continues to be a key focus for BHP.

In addition to having the right assets in the right commodities, we also create value in the way we operate our assets. Our Operating Model allows us to leverage integrated systems and technology, replicate expertise and apply high standards of governance and transparency. 

We love new opinions and innovative ideas. It's the unique experiences and perspectives of our teams that will lead us into the future we're trying to create. We have tremendously talented people at BHP, but our teams are always looking for smarter and more agile ways of doing things to get there faster. Not to mention we have some great leaders here focused on supporting our next great leaders.","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/6b9c78e35a3e999b0b1d409bc6b47611","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Bhp-2","4.1","1199","https://www.bhp.com/careers","Date: 24 Feb 2024

"United Rentals, Inc.","No cash to buy a bulldozer? No worries -- just lease one from United Rentals. The company considers itself the #1 commercial and construction equipment renter in the world, serving customers in the commercial, infrastructure, industrial, and residential sectors. It operates through a network of more than 970 locations in the US and Canada, and provides about 3,000 equipment items -- everything from general to heavy construction and industrial equipment to hand tools, special-event items (such as aerial towers), power (diesel generators) and HVAC equipment, and trench-safety equipment. It also sells new and used equipment, as well as rental-related and contractor supplies and parts. 

In 2012 United Rentals increased its outlet count from more than 530 to more than 970 after it bought rival RSC Holdings in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $4.2 billion, or $18 per share, including $2.3 billion in debt. Both companies have suffered from the recession and combining the two will save more than $200 million a year by eliminating redundant infrastructure, branches, and overhead. The combined businesses will also be in a more strategic position for serving industrial customers.

Before the acquisition, United Rentals held about a 9% market share in the US construction/industrial equipment rental industry. It counts commercial construction as its largest end-market, representing about 54% of its rental revenues. The company's general rentals operations cover seven geographic regions throughout the US and northeast Canada. United Rentals expanded its Canadian operations in 2011 with two acquisitions, first buying Venetor Group, a rental equipment company with seven locations in Ontario, and then Ontario Laser Rentals, a lessor of trench safety equipment with two locations in Ontario and one in Montreal.

Revenue rose about 17% in 2011 compared with 2010. Equipment rentals, accounting for 82% of revenue, surged 17% while the company's next largest segment, sales of rental equipment, 8% of revenue, soared 44%. Sales of new equipment increased 7%. Contractor supply sales and service and other revenue were down 10% and 3%, respectively. Equipment rentals did well behind an increase in the volume of original equipment cost on rent. An increase in rental rates also contributed. Sales of rental equipment were pushed up by increased volume, better pricing, and a new mix of equipment. After weathering a net loss of $62 million in 2009 and one of $26 million in 2010 amid a tough economy, United Rentals enjoyed a net income of $101 million in 2011 along with its strong sales uptick.

United Rentals enhances its operating efficiencies by ramping up through consolidation of functions, including payroll and accounts payable. In order to manage the age, composition and size of its fleet, the company routinely sells used rental equipment and invests in new equipment. United Rentals acts as a dealer of new equipment for many leading equipment makers such as Genie Industries, Skyjack (aerial lifts), Sullair (compressors), and Terex (telehandlers). At most branches United Rentals sells various supplies and merchandise and offers repair and maintenance services.

United Rentals has simultaneously beefed up its presence in the energy market. In late 2011 it purchased the assets of Blue Mountain Equipment Rental Corporation, which caters to the oil and gas industry working in the Marcellus Shale through two locations in Pennsylvania and one in West Virginia. Earlier that year it bought GulfStar Rental Solutions, a power and HVAC equipment rental company in the south. GulfStar adds three locations in Texas and Louisiana, deepening its customer base along the Gulf Coast, as well as paving the way for cross-marketing its general and aerial rental portfolio. 

Although United Rentals' customers range from FORTUNE 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners, it targets larger customers, which tend to rent for longer terms and are timely in payment. Because of its size, United Rentals rallies more resources over smaller businesses. Competitive advantages include more purchasing leverage, a wider range of equipment and services, and the more convenient movement of assets between locations. 

BlackRock, Inc. holds a stake of more than 10% in the rental business. The investment firm is among the world's most established financial advisors","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/128x128/ce70fe2c7eb8fe868be946a5d59f63b6","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/United-Rentals-a3e42836","3.6","1693","http://www.unitedrentals.com","Great company.
